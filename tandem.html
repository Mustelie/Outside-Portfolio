			<h2>What is Tandem?</h2>

			<p>Tandem is an online tool designed to help people function better on teams and to help instructors/managers better support those teams.  Currently, Tandem is being used by student teams in a higher education setting.  In the future, we hope to expand to teams in other settings, such as secondary education and industry.  Tandem is being developed by the University of Michigan's Center for Academic Innovation.</p>

			<p>Tandem provides both team assessment and team instruction.  We aim to increase transparency on teams and provide timely support and instruction based on each team's experiences.</p><br/>
